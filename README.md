# Elixir

This repository is going to be used to track my progress in Elixir. As I've been job hunting, I've noticed that a pretty niche skill to have is Elixir and I'd love to set myself up as a potentially very strong candidate, having experience with a functional programming language that isn't Ocaml.

Currently, my biggest roadblocks have been one-lined functions and pattern matchings:
```elixir
defmodule example do
  def fib(0), do: 0
  def fib(1), do: 0
  def fib(n) when n >= 2, do: fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1)
end
```

However, I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of it and as I do it more, it's becoming easier and easier.

How I've been learning is through YouTube and reading the Elixir documentation. On top of that, as you might've noticed by some file naming, I am learning with one of my friends, Mederick.
